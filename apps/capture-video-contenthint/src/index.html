      <p>
        This demo requires Chrome 57.0.2957.0 or later with
        <strong>Experimental Web Platform features</strong> enabled from
        <tt>chrome://flags</tt>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A stream is captured from the source video using the
        <code>captureStream()</code> method. The stream is cloned and
        transmitted via two separate PeerConnections using 50kbps of video
        bandwidth. This is insufficient to generate good quality in the encoded
        bitstream, so trade-offs have to be made.
      </p>

      <p>
        The transmitted stream tracks are using
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mst-content-hint/"
          >MediaStreamTrack Content Hints</a
        >
        to indicate characteristics in the video stream, which informs
        PeerConnection on how to encode the track (to prefer motion or
        individual frame detail).
      </p>

      <p>
        The text part of the clip shows a clear case for when
        <tt>'detail'</tt> is better, and the fighting scene shows a clear case
        for when <tt>'motion'</tt> is better. The spinning model however shows a
        case where <tt>'motion'</tt> or <tt>'detail'</tt> are not clear-cut
        decisions and even with good content detection what's preferred depends
        on what the user prefers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other MediaStreamTrack consumers such as MediaStreamRecorder can also
        make use of this information to guide encoding parameters for the stream
        without additional extensions to the MediaStreamRecorder specification,
        but this is currently not implemented in Chromium.
      </p>
